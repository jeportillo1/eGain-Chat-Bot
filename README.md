## Approach

I chose to build a laptop selection chatbot because it's a conversation Iâ€™ve had many times whether at work, school, or with friends and family. People often ask me, "Whatâ€™s a good laptop to get?" so this felt like a natural and relatable project.

I started by drafting a simple conversation flow to outline how the chatbot would guide users through the decision-making process. As I began developing the app, I refined the flow based on how the conversation actually played out in code. The final version of the chatbot now fully reflects that updated flow.
